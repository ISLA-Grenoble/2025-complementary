Each root node represents a single input variable (x) and a split point on that variable (assuming the variable is numeric).\n","\n","The leaf nodes of the tree contain an output variable (y) which is used to make a prediction.\n","\n","Given a new input, the tree is traversed by evaluating the specific input started at the root node of the tree.\n","\n","#### Some **advantages** of decision trees are:\n","* Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n","* Requires little data preparation.\n","* Able to handle both numerical and categorical data.\n","* Possible to validate a model using statistical tests.\n","* Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.\n","\n","#### The **disadvantages** of decision trees include:\n","* Overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning (not currently supported), setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n","* Decision trees can be unstable. Mitigant: Use decision trees within an ensemble.\n","* Cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. Mitigant: Training multiple trees in an ensemble learner\n","* Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. Recommendation: Balance the dataset prior to fitting\n","\n","# Random Forest\n","Random Forest is one of the most popular and most powerful machine learning algorithms. It is a type of ensemble machine learning algorithm called Bootstrap Aggregation or bagging.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"obChjVqc7bep"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8sulisrOoGSa"},"source":["## Load necessary libraries\n","You will start by importing the necessary libraries for this lab."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"HLPp9jTEmTtb"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Importing necessary tensorflow library and printing the TF version.\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","\n","print(\"TensorFlow version: \",tf.version.VERSION)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"1k_uHvb0oGSb"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","%matplotlib inline"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lv5dJSNmoGSe"},"source":["## Dataset description\n","Kyphosis is a spinal disorder in which an excessive outward curve of the spine results in an abnormal rounding of the upper back.

There are many patients who get operated for kyphosis and even after the operation the disorder may be present.\n","\n","So the problem at hand is to predict looking at the various factors of the patient whether the patient still has kyphosis disorder after the operation or not.\n","\n","The dataset contains the following columns:\n","\n","\n","1.
